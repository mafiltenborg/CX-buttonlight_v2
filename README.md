# CX-buttonlight_v2

Better version of the LED lightsource for buttons in your [Citroën CX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citro%C3%ABn_CX).

Building on the learnings from [its predecessor](https://github.com/mafiltenborg/CX_buttonlight), the improved version of this little lightsource adds drop-in placement without the need for neither wiring nor the plastic housing from the existing Citroën part. This enables more light or less powerdraw as required by the user. Also, the light module becomes a whole lot easier to manufacture and put in its final position.
