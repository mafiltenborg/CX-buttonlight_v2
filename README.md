# CX-buttonlight_v2

Better version of the LED lightsource for buttons in your [Citroën CX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citro%C3%ABn_CX).

Building on the learnings from [its predecessor](https://github.com/mafiltenborg/CX-buttonlight_v2), the improved version of this little lightsource adds drop-in placement without the need for neither wiring nor the plastic housing from the existing Citroën part. This enables more light or less powerdraw as required by the user. Also, the light module becomes a whole lot easier to manufacture and put in its final position. This version, however, breaks all the originality because it is a component replacement, not a consumables replacement.

Because this device does not use the OE bulb holder (made out of yellow plastic) it allows for the use of any colour LED you fancy. The green light in the ashtray and the green light near the ignition key and the green light emanating from the dashboard computer can now be accompanied by green light from the buttons, making a unison expression. Some might want that...
